1. [A high-performance biosensor design for waterborne bacteria detection based on one-dimensional photonic crystal, 2023, Physica Scripta](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ace5f5)

> An optical biosensor has been designed for detecting many harmful waterborne bacteria which can cause disaster among the humanknd! Transfer matrix method has been used here to find the transmission spectra and the sensitivity of the sensor. Si and SiO2 materials are taken into account for this sensor which are widely used.
